### Key Features:

### User Management:
Registration, authentication, and customer profile management.

### Product Catalog: 
CRUD operations for products and categories with search and filtering capabilities.

### Order History: 
Tracks customer orders and purchase history.

### Admin Dashboard: 
Full control over products, customers, and orders through Djangoâ€™s admin interface.

### API-First Design: 
REST API endpoints for all core resources, ready for frontend or mobile integration.

### Security & Best Practices: 
Role-based permissions, environment variable management for sensitive data, and proper database handling.

This project demonstrates a scalable backend architecture, clean code organization, and practical implementation of Djangoâ€™s ORM, serializers, viewsets, and authentication mechanisms.
